The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Mike C.,"Very good food
Crab cakes were amazing gourmet
The Philly cheese was very tender and juicy"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Michelle M.,"We've come here a few times, once during happy hour and then once during dinner service on the weekend. Both times, the food has been delicious, perfectly priced, and served with a lot of heart.
I recommend both the Philly Dip and the Steak and Baked Fries.
Happy hour menu is great!"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Kim W.,"Came in for a Seahawks game
Pros:
Great for groups, lots of space and doesn't get too crowded which I like. Our server Andrew was amazing and really went out of his way to give us great service.
Cons:
Apparently they released a new menu the day before we came and boy if I knew I would NOT have come here. Way over priced for the type of food you get, basic bar food at restaurant prices. I was planning on coming and getting food all afternoon for the game but fries alone were almost 10$ after tax. Way way way overpriced for what food you get. My group ordered wings (which were good), nachos (alright), backyard burger (burnt) and drinks for each of us. Our bill was over $100. Somethings off if they think this will bring people in."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Eric O.,"Love the restaurant interior, staff is friendly, and drink options are plentiful. Some cons for me were pricy food items, small potions, and TVs mounted too high. I got to the eatery about 30 minutes after they opened. There were only two others in the restaurant. The bartender chatted up all the patrons and was so nice to interact with. Food came out quickly and the plates were properly warmed. I was impressed that the place had large screen TVs all around each wall of the space which was great. My only gripe was they were punted close to the ceiling. So Monday Night Football was on the screen in front of me at the bar and I had to strain my neck a little. All in all a decent spot. I really want to rate this higher, but with the prices/portion ratio is a bit off. I will visit again when there are more patrons. Would like to see service with more people in the spot."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Mike H.,"Let start off by saying WOW, just WOW!! I have never had a steak salad before and i never knew what i was missing until now. I order the black and blue salad. The salad itself was large and had a good portion of steak on it. The salad was fresh and so were all the toppings. The steak was seasoned perfectly and was cooked perfectly. Medium rare to medium. The dressing the salad dressing that came with the salad brought all the flavors together and really set the salad off. I can go on record and say that this is by far one of the best salads that i have ever had. My friends order a Cajun Chicken sandwich and they said that it was delicious as well. I have passed by this place so many times I'm glad i went in and will have to go back."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Amira J.,"first of all, our server mike was so cool n sweet! authentically himself & laid back! he checked on our group often & made sure our water was refilled! it can be hard to feel welcomed by some restaurants especially if you are a black person of color so i just want to say my experience here with the service was amazing!
i met up with my folks here after work around 6. the pub is located at the end of a small lot that's shared with a gas station & a few other small stores. when you walk in it's pretty spacious inside. not really booths but lots of tables n chairs & a bar.
i ordered the large cajun chicken cesar salad 5/5: i was really excited about eating this. the portion of chicken was perfect with the amount of lettuce given. it came with parmesan, & croutons! the dressing wasn't heavy at all & i appreciated this because i was able to feel more refreshed after chowin dooown
overall i had a great experience here & would 100% recommend for happy hour & late dining.
happy hour is from 3-6, 9-close"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Kristy R.,Thank you Kristy.
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Amber Lee A.,"Good food, in a location you wouldn't expect. I drove up to meet a friend and just assumed it was a gas station. I've now been twice and all the items I have tried were very good."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Lena Y.,Thank you Lena .
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Chelsi A.,"Don't judge a book by its cover. I honestly thought it was a small old bar, and if it wasn't for my cousin recommendation I'm not sure we would have gone.
I love the atmosphere, great selection of local beers on tap and DELICIOUS pulled pork nachos; oh man!! I grew up in Renton and will know recommend this place to everyone. We will for sure be back."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Henry L.,"Thank you for your kind words and constructive feedback. We hope to see you here again soon, cheers!"
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Mike S.,"Food was good, beers were cold service was a bit slow but it all worked out. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, fair food portions. Good place to chill."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Deanna D.,"This is the 3rd time I've been here, and I love it! Very personable wait staff, great food selection, and our waiter was charismatic, and very attentive. We had the Brick Philly Dip, and the Black & Blue salad."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Leslie W.,"We tried the Brick when it first opened. The had not worked out the kinks yet and it was all pretty sad. Very slow service, no vegetarian options and only 1 chicken option. Ordered just a salad and my husband had a burger. He felt the burger was tasty and the salad was decent but I don't go to restaurants just to have a salad. The menu was very lacking and extremely limited so never went back. We decided to see if the kinks were gone and tried again last week. Glad we did. The have re-vamped the menu and have a bit more variety and more chicken options. Had a chicken sandwich and my husband had a steak. He enjoyed it and I enjoyed my sandwich too. the food runner was awesome, stopping at all the tables to see if everything was okay. The female waitstaff did not give a rip that we were there. They ignored us even though the sign said seat yourself. We were in a table next to the bar and the blond bartender came over to take our order. Thankfully finally some attention. He was very pleasant and helpful. If not for him we would have left. Prices are fair, there are 8 or so tv's on the walls so always a game to watch. I recommend for the food but again the waitstaff is awful."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Stephen G.,"Our second visit to the Brick Pub. First visit a few months back was not bad.
It took at least 15 minutes for the waiter to come to our table. We ordered drinks and dinner. It took around another 10 minutes for the waiter to bring the drinks over. She was doubling as a bartender too. It took around 40 more minutes to get our food...that's almost an hour since we got there. Not acceptable. Fish from fish and chips was over fried and hard. My wife's flank steak order was sirloin tip according to her, and it was pink on the inside though she ordered it medium well.
All in all, we were pretty disappointed..."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Brad B.,"The Brick is a nice pub with great food, hiding in a gas station parking lot. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the inside is large with lots of seating.
I loved the beer selection at the Brick. They had a whole bunch of local beers that you don't find at many other places, which that alone would keep me coming back.
The food was really good as well! I had a grilled cheese with bacon and peppers and it was awesome! I think it was about $12 which is reasonable.
They also have games out for customers to play, which is always fun when drinking beer with your friends."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Koren C.,Thanks you Koren.
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Senor C.,"This place was SO good. The owner is really cool and the music is always fun.
With that said...
I have now had three bad meals in a row and I am ready to stop trying. That is big bucks I will never get back. How do you screw up a BLT? The bacon was so overcooked that it was more like burnt bacon dust than meat. The ""Philly cheese steak"" was not good and didn't even come with the advertised aioli sauce. My fries sucked and were cold. How on Earth can you make a bad cheese steak? I don't even remember what they screwed up before that but I still remember the dissapointment coupled with a 70 dollar check.
I have had everything on the menu in the past and it ALL used to be good.
Now, I am afraid to order anything.
I sure hope they fix it back to the way it was. There is nothing like this place in the highlands."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Rich L.,"Just wanted to thank the blonde haired girl and bearded guy working tonight for showing racism. We walked in approx 30 mins ago and sat down at the table next to the bar. No acknowledgement even though both of them looked straight at us. Blonde girl started cleaning one of the machines and the bearded guy just kept talking to his friends. We sat the table for 15 mins and neither of them brought a menu or said Hi to us. After I began staring at the girl wondering why we were being ignored, a white couple came in and sat at the bar. Within 30 seconds he had poured them waters and took their order. He made their drinks and we had yet to be greeted or brought a drink menu. Every person in the bar was white including the couple that came in. Coincidence??? Thank you for ruining our evening and reaffirming that asian people are not welcome at the pub."
The Brick Pub & Grill,(425) 207-8951,Andrea I.,Thank you Andrea.
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Ran L.,"True to its name, this place served up a mean falafel sandwich! One of the better vegan sandwiches I've had anywhere.
I've also had one bite of my friend's fish sandwich, which I found to be tasty with inventive flavors.
However, I'm not a huge fan of the potato skins and ins - I found them to be really overcooked both times I've gotten them, one time almost inedibly so.
I'm sure I will be back many times for the vegan sandwich!"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Jean K.,Thanks for the 5-star love Jean. It was super nice to have met you and I’m super thankful that you understood that we were bonkers due to the Fried Chicken pop-up going on. We hope to see you in the shop again soon!
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Ahmed F.,"Ahmed, thank you so much for the 5-star love - and the descriptions you've written make me hungry! (And Freddy's was quite an inspiration in my quest for the perfect smashburger!)"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Heather W.,"Heather, I’m super disappointed we didn’t meet your expectations on this day. Yes we were busy but it doesn’t excuse poor execution.
We are very proud of the Bahn Mi buns we get from the Vietnamese family for our subs - I’m sorry that they fell short in your opinion. I personally love our Jersey Sub with its red wine vinegar and oil dressing, dried oregano, salt and pepper dressed shredded lettuce atop provolone cheese, shop sliced ham, spicy copa and smokey hard salami. What exactly was “just bad” about it? Feedback is so important for me and the team to improve.
Regarding the Buon Appetito being mediocre, what exactly would you have us alter? We use Mary’s Organic chicken breasts that we pound, brine for 4-6 hours and then bread and deep fry, topped with Franks Buffalo May and our shop made Calabrian chili relish and shredded lettuce this sandwich typically bursts with flavor and crunch - I wonder how we missed the mark?
Anyway, we are always interested in improving and your helpful feedback will aid in our growth. If you come to the shop again do please say hello to me and I’d be happy to buy you a sandwich in hopes of improving your opinion of our small brother owned shop."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Maddy L.,"Yay I am a fan! The Mean Sandwich is right next to a brewery, so you can take your food and go over there! The time we waited took a while, but the food is fair priced and very good. I got the italian sandwich and my friend got the med - both very delicious. The potatoes are also very good (highly rec the buffalo ones!!)"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Morgan J.,"The buon appetito sandwich, which is a fried chicken sandwich, was lackluster IMO. There wasn't much flavor and there was way too much bread and not enough chicken. I asked for a side of pickles to jazz it up. The menu is heavy on meats, slaws, pickled stuff, and buffalo sauce, which is not my personal fave but many others will love.
On the bright side, this place is dog friendly with a huge patio out back including ping pong and cornhole! It would be a great place to go with a group of friends. We went at a weird time, like 4 pm on a Thursday, and there was no one else there!"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Samer K.,The grub hub driver lied about picking up my order but I thought it was super thoughtful for the Mean Sandwich staff to contact me and let me know about this issue because I didn't know and just thought food was on the way. Great customer service
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Vijay S.,"Had a mean sandwich (corned beef, cabbage, mustard, mint and maple syrup) with falafel added - was such a great sandwich. They source their meats locally, make their own falafel (really good) and are just the type of place you would want to go to after a few brews (or even pick up a sandwich at lunch)
Highly recommend."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Alyssa M.,"Alyssa, not sure how I missed this great review by you and Scout! Thanks again for the 5-star love! We hope to see you both at the shop again soon!"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Maggie R.,Maggie - thanks so much for the 5-star love! It was great to meet you and your family and hope to see you at the shop again soon!
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Sheri C.,"Spent the afternoon with a friend who suggested we come here for lunch. She told me she had been here before and that I would like it; she was spot on.
Mean Sandwich is a small shop in Ballard that has no frills. Featured in Bon Appetit's 2017 List of America's Best New Restaurants, which I was informed about by my friend, I was intrigued to find a pretty basic menu: 7 sandwiches with 3 daily specials (soup may be one), 1 salad, 3 kinds of fat potato skins: salt & pepper or buffalo sauce or loaded-cheese/chives/bacon bits/more cheese, and yesterday's bun bread pudding.
While my friend and I were staring at the menu trying to decide what to order, a member of BOH came out, started singing loudly along with the 80's song playing and a huge grin. ""What should I get?!"" belted out my friend. ""Buon Appetito,"" he replied. She gushed. He kept singing. She informed me I had to get the skins and share them with her, so we got the salt and pepper.
Buon Appetito is a chicken sandwich with buffalo mayo, provolone, tomato, lettuce, and a pickled pepper relish. It looked huge. It was. My bud ended up taking half the sandwich home for later.
I got the Jersey Sub: capicola, provolone, salami, ham, lettuce, tomato, oregano, oil & vinegar (I asked for no red onion). Amazingly good. Crazy filling. The BREAD, man, the bread. It was like home, only a home I've never had.
Their icon is a pair of lady's lips with red lipstick, and they had free stickers. We each grabbed one. I slapped mine on the back of my day planner which is now in the recycling bin somewhere, and I really, really want to go back and get another sticker. And a sandwich.
You can get delivery. You can get catering. Adult beverages are available. I stuck with a bottle of root beer.
Outdoor seating where your pooch can also sit is available. Tables indoors along with bar stools facing the windows.
Food: 5
Service: 5
Ambiance: 4
Parking: 3 - It's freaking Ballard"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Brendan c.,"I would definitely go back but ratios of sandwiches can be off at times. The guys working there are super nice and the place is spotless. If your lucky to be there when it's open, get a sandwich and if you aren't hungry, get one for later.
Example of poor ratio: is The Fish is really good when you get the right bite and you get a bit of everything. However the sardines are like 10% of the sandwich. The bread is like 40% the sandwich and at times your just eating bread, which is also really good but I want something in between it. Also the fish is between. The lettuce and the slaw so one bite and half of the fish slides right out the back. Next, thing you know your eating a vegan sandwich of slaw and lettuce."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Scott X.,"Only had the Chicken Sandwich...It was excellent!!!
The fries, which are actually deep fried chunks of baked potato are pretty damn good too....

Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Tom C.,"So this review is going to go beyond the incredible sandwiches and touch on the awesome customer experience at Mean Sandwich. We came based on the rumors of a delicious sandwich and were not disappointed. The Mean Corned Beef was awesome. A great version of a staple, including mint to add a touch of sweet flavor. The potato sides were also awesome. The part I really want to highlight though is Dan. When I asked what he recommended, he actually asked questions and gave great guidance. He also checked in on us to see if we were enjoying our sandwiches and asked what we thought of our selections. On our way out the door he thanked us for visiting. I know this all seems minor compared to the food but in today's hipster Seattle food scene I think it's rare to find a spot that not only has great food but also great people that appreciate their customers. Go for the awesome sandwiches, return for the great people!"
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Tori Z.,"Very unique signature sandwich. The meat is juicy and delicious and the sandwich is filled with many strong flavored ingredients - and it works. When I saw maple syrup and mint on the menu I thought it was weird, but it really balances the sandwich well. Overall a great sandwich, I'd love to come back to try other sandwiches, the skins and ins, and play corn hole and ping pong in their courtyard."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Martyn L.,"Mean Sandwich is a high quality sandwich place in the south end of Seattle's Ballard. It serves a limited range of well-produced sandwiches.
The restaurant is in an easy location to reach near the bridge. Parking nearby is limited and we were lucky to find a space in relatively short walking distance. We had come for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy.
Inside there is a very limited set of seating. This is a place that probably works best for takeout, since I wouldn't have felt really confident we could sit down, and don't want to let my food get cold. Service was counter-style, and friendly.
The menu is very limited. I knew this going in, but when faced with the actual choices, there are really only two that appeal to me much and really only one I definitely want.
There is a very appealing sounding side (fried potato lumps called skins and ins). This is exactly the sort of thing I typically love, but it was a bit overcooked and oversalted and I liked it but didn't love it, which was the big disappointment of the visit. I had expected this to be the high point.
When the sandwich arrived, it was great quality. I had a Buon Appetito (chicken). The bread is super - which I think is what tends to be most important. Not too sweet or soft. Great bread. The filling was a bit less exciting. It tasted like pretty normal sandwich fare. Not bad in any way, but not amazing. The portions were giant. With the skins, both of us had about twice as much food as we needed for a lunch and should have shared (except that we wanted completely different things).
Overall, this is a pretty good sandwich place. Much better than most of the regular chains or local places. If something from their tiny selection appeals to you, I recommend a visit. I doubt we'll be going very often, because we didn't bond with the choices we made and there isn't much more we want to try."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Amanda E.,Thanks for the 5-star love Amanda! What a great photo you took of the Mean Sandwich as well! We look forward to having you at the shop again soon!
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,J B.,"Are you in the mood for a really exceptional sandwich experience? Then I highly recommend Mean Sandwich and do get The Mean and an order of fries. The burger is really good. I'm looking forward to trying the other items on the menu and I'm thinking they'll be pretty good. Staff is very friendly (parking can be a bit tough, but there is street parking)."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,David B.,"Nice staff. Cool location.
I think we were oversold on the sandwiches. The hype hurt.
These were solid sandwiches.
The Mean, JCVH and Italian were ok. Nothing stellar. Ironically our veg in the group really loved the falafel sandwich. I agreed and felt a little cheated with my choice of the Italian and the too vinegary sauce and almost Jersey Mike's level of presentation.
I had and have high hopes that some adjustments will help this place live up to the hype like Dingfelders was finally able to do after some adjustments."
Mean Sandwich,(206) 789-9999,Dominique S.,"Dominique, thanks for the 5-star love! So stoked you like the bread pudding...we love it and its a great way to use up day old buns so that the sandwiches are always on fresh buns. Till next time!!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Karrissa D.,"I called this evening to verify their cacio e pepe is vegetarian, and it is! yay!
I ordered the cacio e pepe and a slice of sourdough bread through uber eats. The flavor of the cacio e pepe is quite different from what I've had before, I think it's the aged cheese that really made the difference. It was delicious though! The pasta was perfectly cooked (& fresh!) and the 'sauce' still had a really good pepper flavor. The sourdough also came with a light drizzle of olive oil and salt which complemented the pasta perfectly.
Only downside was the temperature, but that's a given with delivery. Definitely looking forward to being able to visit once everything is back open, as this was my first time trying their food. I'm for sure going to order some fresh pasta for home in the future too."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Andrea O.,"I'm Italian and I'm very picky and demanding when it comes to Italian food (or food in general for that matter). Well Due is among my favorite places to get real genuine Italian food. Everything is good and authentic, my favs these days are the pasta cacio e pepe with guanciale and Tiramisù. This is a must try, it will become one of your favorites too"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Becca H.,"Due' Cucina is a great spot for lunch or dinner! The prices are great, the servers and atmosphere are relaxed and welcoming, and the food is amazing. My go-to order is the Traditional Bolognese Ragu with traditional spaghetti. My boyfriend orders the Aglio & Olio with healthy campanelle and adds fried tofu. Be sure to get tiramisu, sharing is an option size-wise, but you won't want to. It's to die for! We placed an order for pick-up today since the city is still under the stay-at-home order. There was no fuss and no wait to get our food. We're going to continue supporting Dué through the coronavirus pandemic and beyond. Yum!!!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Jen H.,"Thank goodness this place delivers all the way to Kirkland! I miss eating out in Seattle so I was super thankful and appreciative that we were in the delivery area.
I ordered the kale pesto campanelle and it was amazing!! I would definitely order this again. It was cooked perfectly - nice and chewy. My partner ordered the eggplant parm and he was a little disappointed with the portion size; it came in a tiny little box. He was jealous of my kale pesto pasta which I hesitantly shared with him. We shared the tiramisu at the end of our meal and it was fantastic, one of the best tiramisu I have had in awhile. Definitely planning on ordering here more while this pandemic is going on. Highly recommend!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Richard U.,"3.5 star place!
Interesting casual dining pasta place up in Cap Hill. I was looking to support local restaurants still open during the shelter at home mandate in effect and luckily they are still open for take out.
Stuff tried:
Eggplant parmesan: i am only person i know that actually craves eggplant parm. The version here is not crispy at all but it is exceedingly delicious! My only gripe is that the portion size is tiny. If you are remotely hungry i would order two servings.
Mushroom with truffle oil on healthy pasta: i am a sucker for mushroom truffle oil anything. Chose the healthy pasta which is made from some type of bean flour instead of wheat giving it a toothy consistency. The pasta has touted health benefits but the consistency might be offputting for some folks. Flavor was pretty good however
Bruschetta caprese: nice slab of grilled bread with fresh toppings. I admit that the to go version seems to have left my bruschetta a bit soggy. Eat this first next time"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Holly L.,"Hi Holly,
We are glad you like the food. I am sorry that GrubHub took so long to deliver your food. I reviewed your order: your food was ready after 9 minutes the order was placed, and then was picked up by the driver about 10 minutes later. Although the service GrubHub provided is terrible we are not responsible for it as we have no control on the delivery and I would like to ask you to not penalize us. I suggest you to contact GrubHub customer service and ask for compensation.
Let me know if I can further help you."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Marie B.,"I love pasta and have been to just about every Italian spot in Seattle. Handmade pasta, I'm there! Pasta in a casual setting, even better! Most often though, I don't have access to the likes of Il Corvo, Pasta Casalinga, G.H. Pasta, Ristorante Machiavelli, Tavolata, or La Vita e Bella because I currently don't work in Seattle.
However, the very first Yelper I ever met is credited for the recommendation to Due' Cucina Italiana *Bryan K* Clearly, I had been under a rock and late to the pasta bowl party at this popular Capitol Hill/Broadway spot. I've interacted with the two brothers than run DCI, great charismatic business owners. Brilliant concept and business hours until 2200! Great counter staff and efficient kitchen crew. A variety of seating are available whether dining solo, pairs or larger groups. Just remember to kindly bus your table at the end!
My first visit was back in December 2018 (been open since October 2016!) and have been back so many times that honestly I've lost count. This is a long overdue Yelp review as I just had a custom pasta bowl for dunch/linner hours ago (1/27/20).
Assorted fresh pasta that's crafted on site. Your pasta bowl is customized by selecting type of pasta, sauce, and other ingredients from the giant wall signage. Order and pay at the counter, then find a place to sit if dining onsite. There's also brisk takeout and delivery traffic.
In about 15-20 minutes your name is called or check the status on the order monitor. I like to admire my pasta bowl and then dig in while nice and hot. Feeling raveneous, one can easily polish off a bowl. Most often, I have tasty leftovers for another meal.
Another item I've had often (but not today) is their delicious tiramisu. Enough to share, or not!
So thank you Bryan K, Due' Cucina Italiana has become one of my regular spots.
High quality, delicious, affordable, satisfying, highly recommended!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Theresa L.,Ordered from here for the first time last night. Had delivered and dropped at the front door. Everything was timely manor and tasted great! Can't wait to try more
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Julia L.,"Had a lovely lunch here recently! The place is modern, clean, well lit (large windows) with plenty of open seating. Remember to seat yourself & bus your own table. My group tried a variety of the sauces...
- traditional bolognese: rich, hearty, filling
- cacio & pepe: the cheese flavor was very sharp and strong, delicious but a bit too much for me
- amatriciana: lots of tomato flavors + smokey, savory goodness in the form of guanciale (cured pork cheek)
- mushroom & white truffle oil: creamy, thick, but not too heavy. Wonder, well balanced flavors between the mushroom and truffle oil (personal favorite out of the 4 sauces)
The pastas were all fresh and perfectly al dente (firm, chewy). Personally enjoyed the rigatoni and ca campanelle best. Would recommend and come back again!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Pauli D.,"Who knew such a cute little pasta shop could be found in cap hill? The sauces are pretty light and the noodles are cooked just enough to still have that bite where it sticks to your teeth. You won't feel heavy with cheese or sleepy from too many carbs. You order first then pick up your food in the back from the kitchen. It's bus yourself when you are finished here, they have water in the back and utensils available on the table.
The tiramisu is also very very nice and I usually don't even like tiramisu so a round of applause for that. We need to come back and try more dishes because for the low price you get a great amount of food."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Edward A.,"Friendly staff, in a way. I was told the order line starts near the entrance. I thought i had to order at the food pickup area. Oops.
I had eggplant parmesan. Pretty tasty little appetizer dish. My wife had the only pasta dish that was rated high on the al dente-ish. Those noodles were rather undercooked. Felt like i was eating them raw. But i guess thats what it is by definition? I can definitely see the appeal."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Yvonne Yiyao X.,"Can't believe it took me so long to find this place. Friendly service. Reasonably priced. Food is fast and fresh. Delicious sauce. Pasta is al dente. I loved both pasta dishes and the tiramisu. I see their take out orders coming out rapidly. The store is not super busy or overwhelming. The owner actually cares about his business and was cleaning up here and there. The kitchen is bright and clean - always a good thing to be able to see the kitchen.
Four stars but only because of my love to Il Corvo. This is a place I'll certainly come back soon."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Cristina G.,"I have ordered this twice to be delivered to my office using uber eats. This is the best italian pasta I have eaten in Seattle with the exception of Barolo. The pasta is definitely made freshly from scratch and cooked perfectly al dente chewy.
My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.
I would pass on ordering any of the breads."

I'm a huge fan of white tile on white grout walls because it really brightens up the place. The servers are super friendly and nice. Food came out in less than ten minutes. It's cool to see all the pasta being made behind the counter. The place is really clean.
FOOD
We went with the Mushroom and White Truffle Oil with Pork Sausage and the Traditional Bolognese both with their recommended pastas. You could definitely taste the freshness of the pasta (not that I had any doubt because they literally make it behind the counter). The noodles had a great bounce, while still remaining a perfect al dente.
The sauces were great, but honestly just didn't fit my preferred palette. Completely a personal thing. The wine hints in the bolognese were too pronounced for my liking. I prefer a meatier and drier bolognese. It was hard to taste the truffle in the other dish. Then again it's $13, you can't expect much. I would have preferred more cream, but again, it's just personal preference!
OVERALL
Great vibe, I love being able to choose different sauces and noodles. I'd come back if I was in the area for a different dish."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Monica L.,"I'm not a pasta lover whatsoever. I eat pasta maybe once or twice a year. But I about licked my plate and my friend's plate. Holy moly. I couldn't get enough of my lasagna and her campanelle.
The staff is super friendly too. You pick up your food, grab your own water, and bus your own table. You have to go up to the counter to order too. There's no waiter but nobody cares because the pasta is out of this world.
It's too bad I don't live right above the building. I'm now a total convert."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Tracy C.,"Hi Traci,
I am sorry to hear that you did not have a good experience in our restaurant. We pride ourself of good friendly service and quality food.
I wish you told us about the issue with your food when you were at the restaurant, our staff is trained to resolve the issue timely and be sure that everyone that leave our premise will have a positive experience.
If you are interested in giving us another shot, I'd love to host you again at Due' for a complimentary meal, and in that occasion hopefully also collect more feedback from you. Just send me an email to info@duecucina.com and we can get it arranged.
Thanks again for your time and valuable feedback!

Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Jen L.,"Hi Jen,
Firstly, my apologies for getting back to you on this review so late! It has been an incredibly busy month, add some travels in the mix... and somehow we missed your review :(
My second apology is for the inconvenience you encountered during your meal with us.
With regards to your comment on pasta temp: I understand your frustration. We use a plate and bowl warmer exactly to avoid issues like this, however last month the equipment broke and we had a few days of gap before we received the new unit from the manufacturer. We tried our best to ensure customers would not perceive the difference, and luckily we didn't get complains during that time, however it looks like your order was affected.
With regards to salmon: it's hard for me to judge from the pic, however our salmon pasta comes with a scoop of salmon meat on top. If you didn't receive it, it was probably a mistake committed by our plater.
I am glad to offer you a refund on your pasta dishes to compensate you for the bad experience, or alternatively a free meal on us to give us another shot! Please let me know if you are interested in any of these options and we'll get it done asap!
Thank you for your kind feedback, looking forward to hearing back from you soon!

Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,Melody Y.,"Oh my goodness the food is absolutely incredible here! The pasta is fresh, cooked to al dante perfection, and tasted amazing. I love how they offer sublime quality Italian dishes in a casual environment.
Being from Vancouver, I never thought there'd be a place like this. Wanting Italian food always means paying significantly more for a fine dining experience. Not only is Due Cucina super casual, but the prices are also affordable as well. I highly recommend adding a poached egg to your pasta! Elevates the experience to a whole other level."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,(206) 397-4375,chara c.,"Hi Chara,
We are sorry to hear that you did not have a great experience in our restaurant. We pride ourself with the quality of our pasta above everything else. We are a counter spot casual restaurant and we are sorry to hear that you had different expectation. For what concern the ""bite"" let me point out that you had the campanelle (rated 2/5 on our aldentness scale and the bucatini that is hollow inside, so it has intrinsically less bite). If the sauce was too salty that might have been a mistake, however on the cheese side we use a Pecorino Romano of the finest quality to balance the sweetness of the sauce and recreate the authenticity and peasant origin of the dish, but I understand that could be too strong for some. I believe that our food is much better than what you experience today and I would like to invite you for a complimentary meal, a good occasion for us to gather more feedback and hopefully win you back.
Sincerely
Filippo"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Sarah M.,"Yummy, with big portions. Had takeout during the Covid epidemic, and during this time they are offering 20% off to go orders -- even for wine. I can only imagine how it would be even better for a sit down visit and can't wait for the chance to go back during better times."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Dan T.,"We ordered takeout yesterday due to the quarantine of the city. The food was absolutely delicious. Some of the best Italian food we have ever had and so welcome during these challenging times. Chef Antolin is the best at his craft.
We will definitely be calling in another order soon. For everyone who wants a truly first class meal please support this restaurant and their staff.
Thank you for making our dinner and evening so enjoyable at home."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Mike V.,"Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,David P.,"Honestly, I think Pomodoro is the best Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've been to fancier places in Seattle, to cheaper places, but the food and people at Pomodoro are second to none.
I used to live in Boston where I was lucky to have experienced authentic Italian food in the North End area of the city. Being able to get home-y Italian food is one of the things I miss the most about Boston and Pomodoro fills that void for me.
The food is no frills, just good food. The owners and staff are genuine and warm. We would highly recommend checking out Pomodoro!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Chris A.,"A chef that's cooked for the King of Spain? Sign me up... xD
I've been living in Seattle for almost 10 years and Pomodoro continues to be one of my go to spots for visitors and for when I want to treat myself! Prices are very reasonable and the food and service is amazing.
Pomodoro is an awesome mixture of Spanish Basque and Italian. I've been numerous times, always ordered something new, and have always enjoyed my meal. Also can someone figure out what is in that avocado pesto that is brought to every table? Its so GOOD! xD."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Thao N.,"First of all, happy birthday to one of my best friend, Jordan!!!
She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xD
There's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Nicole A.,"I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen.
To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy.
For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Janhavi B.,"Pomodoro is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Seattle. There are fancier ones, but the food and service here are is unparalleled. I would say that Pomodoro is pricier than some others (e.g. Ristorante Machiavelli) but it more than makes up with the personal touch and the fact that you can get a table way more easily! Located on the relatively quiet Eastlake Avenue - it's almost easy to miss, but their handmade pastas, and dessert (tiramisu and creme brulee) are a must-try. Almost every pasta and special I have tried so far has been delicious so I can't recommend anything specific but highlight recommend a visit here! With 1 entree per person, a dessert and a bottle of wine, it may end up costing you close to $40-50 a pop."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jordan N.,"I've been here two times already and both times have been amazing! They have free parking behind the restaurant and can make​ reservations online for big parties in advance.
Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and ​light cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!
Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!
I love coming here and would love to try new things on their menu when I have another chance. Highly recommended to those who love Italian and Spanish dishes."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jacqueline H.,"Came here for a friend's birthday and had a great meal! The restaurant is in a quiet area of Eastlake and is pretty low key. The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil!
For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing! Overall, a great Italian restaurant that is super low key but has delicious food. Highly recommend!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Heidi L.,"I was looking for a nice date night spot for my boyfriend and I since we were craving Italian food for our anniversary. The restaurant wasn't too busy at the time we came in. The chef, himself stopped by our table asking how our food was, he then recommended a spicy oil that would go well with my special pasta. I love spicy food so that was a pleasant experience and it complimented the food well. Both the pasta dishes were filled with flavor and just danced in our taste pallet. It had us talking about it for the rest of the evening haha. I would definitely comeback for another date night!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Lynden L.,"My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time.
The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.
I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though!
The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jun Li Z.,"Came here on a date in October 2018. The pasta dishes are great and I recall the service was really good. I recommend coming here on dates or with a friend. The atmosphere is quite chill, low lighting which can be romantic or hard for your partner to see the menu ;)"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Amanda I.,"I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first.
For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price.
Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!
If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option. The food is a little pricier but it is delicious. The ambiance creates a more upscale feel and the service is on point."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Sloan C.,"Went there last Friday night. Although I was late for my reservation, they were nice enough to find a table for me and my friend. Food was great. Ordered linguine with cream and anise sauce and shrimp. The sauce was balanced - flavorful yet not too heavy. The pasta was topped with some grapes, which I found interesting. I also ordered ab octopus side and it was soooo tender. Would definitely come back again to try other items from the menu!"
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Annalise W.,"Love this place. Perfect little neighborhood Italian restaurant. Ideal for date nights, celebrating, or if you're just craving some delicious Italian food. Romantic, intimate, and homey vibe.
Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.
Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Alex O.,"Best fettuccine Alfredo hands down. At least for me. I don't know why but it has such an interesting taste. Different from all the other Alfredo dishes I've had. I just want to eat more and more. It has a Spanish twist to it. If you order it's Polla al Jerez. The tiramisu is also heavenly. I need to stop trying the other desserts and just stick with this one.
The snow crab pasta is also exceptionally good. I need to get this one again. If only I could eat pasta everyday."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Artemis L.,"I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Jacey H.,"Yes, yes, yes. Great service, cozy little atmosphere. Not pretentious. Everything was perfect."
Pomodoro,(206) 324-3160,Michael G.,"Excellent all around.
We came on a Friday night. Many open tables, but they were committed to upcoming diners, so we were seated at the bar. Our good luck since we got to chat up many people behind the bar.
Interesting menu choices, tapas, full dishes, that start traditional Italian but also have a Spanish twist to many items.
We had veal marsala and vodka penne. The marsala was particularly adventurous. Great wine by the glass choices.
Tiramisu is a have-to-have. Eastlake should be proud to have this in their neighborhood!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,John W.,"What a nice find, downtown Seattle -
I wish local-to-me Italian restaurants could pull off the kind of affordable home-made Italian that this place does, right in downtown Seattle, no less.
If I was local, I'd be coming here quite often - I don't know how they make Italian this low of price, and this high of quality. I would have expected to pay more. Heck, in my town, homemade Italian of any kind is starting at over $20 a plate.
This place is comparable in price to Old Spaghetti Factory and Olive Garden (but obviously is worlds better)."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Ken H.,"This is a treasured establishment that always delivers. It is and shall remain a Seattle favorite.
It is small and quaint and it fills up very quickly.
If you go, go when it opens because it will be full by the time you leave.
Spaghetti and Meatballs are amazing and the veal dishes are out of this world.
They also have a great Caesar salad that you can get the WHITE SPANISH ANCHOVIES with and its worth it.
Friendly, but not always warm and if busy, a feeling of being rushed.
Still, a great spot for good food."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Zachariah H.,"I've been to Machiavelli 3 or 4 times now but my opinion of it goes down each time. While the food + price is 5 stars, the wait time & experience makes me feel miserable. Here's my most recent (Tuesday night!) experience:
I arrive and meet two of my friends who are sitting on a bench in the entry hall. Our 4th friend is running late so we can't put our name down yet. This entry hall is maybe 4 feet wide with a small bench & people streaming in and out past the small horde of people waiting. Claustrophobic. After 10 minutes or so, some seats open up in the slightly less crowded bar area. We sit and it's bearable but not like we actually get anything to drink since a) no one comes by to take such an order & b) we're here to eat Italian food not drink shitty alcohol. The clincher is that after our 4th arrives, I have to jostle for position with the other prospective diners as we flag down a harried receptionist who exasperatedly writes our names on the wait list. After 20 minutes, we're finally ready to begin waiting for a table.
Many other restaurants in Capitol Hill also have bad wait times but they usually also:
- Take a phone number & call/text when the table is ready.
Or
- Let you put your name down before your whole party is there."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Prag R.,"Incredibly LONG wait time. We waited for 2 hours to get a table last night. Wish they accepted phone reservations, wonder how this never bothered them as many Yelpers have given the same feedback!
FOOD-
While waiting for the table, we hung around the bar and ordered few drinks and small plates. They were okay. We ordered the main course as soon as we got seated. The bread was good, soft and fresh. Its free for the first time and you pay on from the second order. We got the Spinach Ravioli and my Veal Saltimbocca and they both were so yummy! Worth the wait time definitely."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Khanh N.,"I am sooo glad I found this cute little place! Shoutout to my boyfriend for finding it on his Yelp search!
This cute little place was packed when we got there around 8pm on a Friday night. We put or name down (they quoted as an hour) and went elsewhere for a drink because the bar area was packed as well. The layout of the restaurant is a bit odd and a little difficult to get in and out with people wait on the bench but I think it adds to its charm. Just be prepared to wait but there are tons of places around to grab a drink or explore :)
We came back an hour later. And they called two names that didn't show and then we were up! They quoted us time perfectly. Going into the restaurant area you can see why it's such a long wait. I think I counted about 14 tables for the entire restaurant.
We sat down. Got bread. We ordered drinks. Drinks came so fast. We got a half carafe of red wine. And then we ordered. And our food came. It was such fast and great service! We felt cared for but also didn't feel like they were bothering us all the time. The bread is from Macrina bakery and it was delish! Our pastas that we got were UNREAL. Such good portions sizes and DELICIOUS.
Best part of this was that it was $44 before tip and we were stuffed and had leftovers. That's definitely a STEAL!!
Probably are new go to date night spot. Seriously love this place."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Nancy W.,"I haven't been here for a few years but still love the place. Very small venue and they don't take reservations so either get there early or plan on a wait. We were here on a Friday night and got to the restaurant about 5:15 and they were just about full, even after opening at 5. As an appetizer we ordered the Bresaola Alla Valtinellese which is cured beef, olive oil and lemon topped with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese. My friend ordered the fettuccine carbonara and I ordered the lasagna bolognese. Both were excellent, although I would have liked to have had more bolognese sauce. Noticed that in between some of the layers of lasagna there was nothing but pasta on top of pasta. Wine was nothing exceptional. Didn't order dessert but now wish I had as they featured a chocolate mousse tiramisu. Big regret there. Small cozy bar with good music."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Danielle D.,"TLDR
I'm Italian and from NY--my standards for Italian food are high.
Seattle has a way of taking any type of soul food & making it unapproachable, so when searching through all of the restaurants I was reluctant.
I was given a few Italian restaurant suggestions, but they all were an abrupt ""no"". Through my own search, I found Machievelli. I was hesitant at first--bc yelp photos make it seem like a pizza shop--but
Took a chance.
I was blown away.
There are TWO rooms, a bar area /waiting room and a romantically lit dining room.
Tiny, but the feel and smell brought back NY memories.
I was seated with bread. Thank goodness. Put away 3 plates myself.
Gave them additional tests & ordered the traditional antipast, eggplant parm, & tiramisu.
WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!
They are a restaurant I will forever go to --and send people to!
Bring cash trust me.
Oh man I loved this restaurant."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Janhavi B.,"My new go-to for a casual Italian dine-out experience. Authentic, delicious and not unnecessarily expensive (unlike most Italian joints in town). We were 3 people and shared the red pepper penne with shrimp, the carbonara and a half-carafe of wine! We ended up paying about $25 a pop. You can expect a long wait given its location in Capitol Hill but you can wait with a drink in the bar area and should get in within 30- 45 minutes. All in all - highly recommend for an amazing Italian fare!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Isaiah G.,A friend referred me here. We we're in Seattle and our hotel was only two blocks away. We decided to come here for valentines. I can't really judge the wait based on going on the busiest holiday in the year. The is a small but really cute restaurant. As soon as you walk in there's a bench you can sit at if you need to wait. There's a good size bar with tables to the right. Up two steps is the hostess. Once you go to what is considered the second floor it's a small restaurant. I almost felt like I was in a home. The bread and oil they gave with the bread was really good. I ordered a Cesar salad that was pretty good too. My husband ordered your typical spaghetti and meat balls. To my surprise it was pretty authentic and very delicious. I ordered pasta with a white sauce and prawns. My dish was just as good if not better. The service was very good and professional. I would definitely be returning.
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Jenny C.,"Machiavelli is a good basic Italian place that is very popular with the locals. There is almost always a wait but we showed up after 8pm on the Saturday and only waited 20 minutes so that was reasonable. The server promptly brought us ice water and Columbia City bread. The bread was definitely fresh with a soft interior and a chewy crust. The dipping sauce is unique too and sold in bottles for $6.50. The wines by the glass were reasonably priced at $7.50-$8.50 per glass.
We ordered the Linguine alle Vongole $12.95 and the Fettucine Carbonara $13.95. My favorite was the linguine. The linguine had a very flavorful spicy garlic red sauce. On the other hand, the carbonara sauce lacked salt despite the bacon and the pasta was served lukewarm which detracted from our enjoyment of it. Oddly enough, the carbonara had a smaller portion size too compared to the linguine despite being the pricier entree.
Two options were available for dessert tonight: housemade tiramisu or vanilla cheesecake. We opted for the tiramisu and were not disappointed. The ladyfingers were soaked with the perfect amount of liquid and had a good coffee flavor without being soggy. The whipped mascarpone on top was a nice touch. Normally tiramisu is layers of mascarpone and ladyfingers alternating but Machiavelli does it differently and I like how there is less cream than usual.
This is a solid place and service was good so we will definitely be back but skipping the carbonara."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Dione L.,"Me and my boyfriend always walk by this restaurant and have been dying to go. We finally made it over here and literally probably MY FAVORITE italian spot in seattle.
The staff/ service was fantastic. The restaurant was super cozy and fun. The food is super reasonable and portions were good.
The pasta was super fresh i got the spaghetti with garlic and olive oil. Super light and good flavors. I'm going to have dreams about this pasta no joke!
10/10 come"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Carol B.,"Honestly, how can you not love this place. It's the perfect place for authentic Italian food and it's so cheap! We've tried so many different dishes here and love each and every one. If I had to make one recommendation, it would be to try the linguine and clams. Don't forget a wine pairing!
Full warning, there's essentially no parking in this area of capitol hill so you should walk or take a ride share. There's almost always a wait, so plan accordingly. The inside is quite small which means it gets loud quickly, but again it's all worth it. We can't stay away"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Victoria H.,"Machiavelli was amazing! It is truly a little Italian treasure on Capitol Hill! I have lived in the neighborhood for a while, but recently decided to try it out and so glad I did!
The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five was the LONG wait. Otherwise, it's a fantastic restaurant! The servers and hostess were all really nice and the food is DELICIOUS. It was definitely some of the greatest Italian food that I have had in Seattle! I really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant as well. Very hip and casual.
Myself and my friend both had the Chicken Parmigiana and we loved it! It was cooked to perfection and had a layer of sauce over it that was amazing! The cheese melted on top was delicious as well, and to top it off the ground parmesan cheese on top of it made it everything! The spaghetti that came as a sodr dish was delicious as well!
For dessert, I had their in-house made vanilla bean cheesecake, which was phenomenal. It had a Graham cracker crust that just melts in your mouth. One of the best tasting cheesecakes I have ever had!
I definitely enjoyed Machiavelli and I will be returning. :) Please note, if you go on a weekend night, please be prepared to wait a while. However, your wait will be worth it! :)"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Nita L.,"TLDR: Amazing food, cheap prices, ridiculously long wait times for both food and a table.
Food: You get a free serving of bread for the table which was fresh and soft, also much needed because the wait for food was really long. We ordered a half carafe of the house wine to drink, the spinach ravioli - which was creamy and well cooked and my ultimate favorite- The chicken liver lasagne. The chicken liver lasagne takes 25 mins to cook and every bite of it is well worth the wait.
Ambience & Service: This is a cozy restaurant with limited seating so the wait times here are incredibly long. I had to wait for more than an hour to get a table for 2. They don't accept phone reservations either. You can chill at the bar while you wait.
Cost: This is where this restaurant won me over. Cost us just 46$ for a dinner for two people that included 2 glasses of wine per person and 2 entrees. This is a very decent price to pay for the quality of food you get here.
My only complaint is the wait times involved. Else this place is awesome!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Michael G.,"Trattoria atmosphere, large menu, passable service in a very busy location. Tight tables make for a loud atmosphere.
Extensive menu. We had the eggplant and tortellini with creme sauce, both were spot on. There are so many Italian joints in this general area, this is a good choice for the price. Carafe wine was decent.
We will return."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Jenn N.,"We had to wait 1hr, but the food was really worth it.
The Caesar salad with white anchovies was EXCELLENT. Probably the best salad I've ever had, thought it may or may not have been caused by the 1hr wait time. Anyway, the white anchovy add on is a must.
For the main course, I got the chicken liver lasagna. It was delicious, but I also like eating organs (fair warning for those who don't like eating organs normally and want to see if they'd like it. You won't because the distinct flavor was definitely still there)."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Tom B.,"I've eaten here 18 years now. Moved away, but every time I come back to Seattle, this is a must. Cozy and delicious. Chicken Piccata
fresh lemon, capers, sweet butter - my personal favourite with a side of spaghetti. Oh man. I need to get back up there! Well done you."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Elizabeth K.,"I absolutely loved my meal here! I was in the mood for a more basic pasta dish, something like plain spaghetti with marinara, and Machiavelli offered that. However, I was delighted to end up enjoying the red pepper pasta. It was creamy and full of flavor - perhaps the best pasta I've ever had. After my first bite, I thought, ""can I come here again tomorrow?"" I also got the mixed greens salad, which was served with a great dressing.
The restaurant was busy, but the wait staff was attentive and friendly. One of the staff members took some photos of a group that had finished dining, even though the restaurant was pretty busy. I thought that was kind."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Sou M.,"My friend was craving carbs a few nights ago and she loves italian, so we looked this place up and decided to go.
When we got there, there was a 30-40 mins wait time (on a Tuesday). We were waiting at the bar area and asked the server if we can just order food or appetizers at the bar and she said we can do that. The bartender, however, denied to take our food order or even showing us the menu!
After finally getting the table, we ordered an eggplant parmesan and a penne pasta with red pepper and walnut. They served complementary olive bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette which we loved!
The eggplant parmesan was just ok, it was too cheesy and not as breaded as we like. The pasta was really good and creamy.
The server was nice and attentive. The ambience is old and cosy, with dim lighting. The wait time for food was long. The value for price is good since the portions are big."
Ristorante Machiavelli,(206) 621-7941,Pinky P.,"This place was recommended to us by family who lives close by. And thank heaven they did! When we first walked in, I was scared we wouldn't get a table. Always a good sign in my book when a restaurant is packed but even a better sign when it's a random Tuesday night!
The service was incredible from the minute we walked in. Everyone was so friendly.
We ordered the chicken parmigiana and the spinach ravioli. The ravioli was delicious and they didn't skimp on the tomato cream sauce. Pretty delicious. The chicken parmigiana blew our minds! We both decided it was by far THE BEST we have ever had! The sauce was so perfect and the chicken portion was perfect. Usually it's too thick and you loose the flavors eating the chicken.
Last we had the chocolate mousse tiramisu. It was also good. I preferred the moose over the rum dipped lady fingers.
The only slight improvement would be the bread in the beginning (which was complimentary). It was really hard and chewy but really does not matter with everything else being so amazing! Go eat the chicken parm here! You won't regret it!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Phil G.,"A week ago, we were told Tavolata wouldn't do take out. I phoned tonight, 3/13/2020, and sure enough, Tavolàta was happy to have us pick up food. We have been on a social distance quarantine since the Coronavirus pandemic erupted. I guess other people aren't reading the same research I am. People were out and about, in spite of the rain, and in spite of any contagious virus. The bars on 2nd Avenue were full, including the bar at Tavolàta. I felt foolish, locking myself inside all week, but then again, my age is susceptible to complications if I contract the Coronavirus. Foolish, paranoid, overly cautious, vigilant, better safe than sorry; who knows?
The food from Tavolàta was good. Our rigatoni and pappardelle pastas were good. The Arancini balls were a bit bland for my taste. Carpaccio was okay. Bread was well baked. Prices were Seattle high - $100 for this meal. Expensive, but there isn't much choice in the Emerald City. This is not an egalitarian city anymore."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Brian B.,Great service! Great food! Definitely Italy recommend the knoche! My wife and I will definitely be back
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Maia R.,"Terribly disappointing experience, and had it not been for our waitress, this would be one star. I had made our reservations the day Valentine's Day reservations opened and the menu posted at Tavolata. Despite our early booking, we were seated in the very center of a communal table (that, as I recall, I had specifically requested to avoid). The table was too loud for me and my boyfriend to even speak to each other, so we requested to be moved to another table. Meanwhile there were several other couples at their own tables, including one couple at a 4-top. They sat us at the bar, which was fine.
Once we were seated at the bar, we reviewed the menu. The menu in our hands had almost entirely different courses for the pasta and entree from what Tavolata had posted online and the menu we had so been looking forward to. This was incredibly disappointing and deceptive in my opinion.
Our waitress at the bar was lovely (blonde curly hair and tall). But the servers left dirty plates on our spot for too long (I had to ask them to clear the appetizer plates) and they did not seem appropriately trained. I overheard one server saying it was his third day at the job, and the hosts (we were sitting directly next to them) were cursing and mocking some of the patrons to each other by the end of our dinner.
Also, our ticket for our 2nd and 3rd courses ""got lost."" We waited over 1.5 hours for our pasta course after getting the appetizers. When our waitress told us this, she was apologetic but didn't offer any recourse until I asked her if we could have more wine since we had drank the glass that was supposed to be paired with our course. She was happy to oblige but it was pretty clear all we would have gotten was an apology otherwise. When we finally got our pasta, it was cold.
The food was okay. Porchetta was way too salty with huge salt crystals and peppercorns intact that made a difficult texture to chew. If they had had their promised menu I would have ordered the lobster (by the way, Tavolata, don't promise this as a menu item if you aren't positive you'll get it. We had thought about going to the lobster dinner at Derby but didn't because we saw we would get lobster on this menu. What a waste.) Mushroom ravioli was okay but not what I was looking forward to going into the meal. Port wine pairing was cheap and too sweet. 2.5 hours later we left our meal feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.
I've had quite a few experiences with Tavolata before this, but after being so disappointed with this deceptive and uncomfortable experience, I will never be returning."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Zachary H.,"My gf and I went here for our anniversary.
We were hoping to get the happy hour deals but the bar was full so we sat at a table. It's a bit annoying that the happy hour is only offered at the bar and not at the tables. If I sat 3 feet away from my table seat my dinner would've been deeply discounted for the same food. Oh well.
Upon being seated, the waiter gave us each a small glass of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary. That was a kind gesture and was appreciated. We ordered some drinks and our meals and waited in anticipation. I ordered the pappardelle and my gf got a carbonara dish. The food was stellar. When it arrived at the table it was one of those dishes that doesn't look like a lot of food until you start eating it. We also ordered the bruschetta with smoked salmon. It was tasty but I'd probably try another appetizer next time.
The service was exceptional and food was awesome. I hope to return at some point and hopefully get a spot at the bar for happy hour!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Kamara S.,"Out of all the Italian restaurants I visited in Seattle, I have to say Tavolàta is one of my faves.
I have been to both restaurants multiple times. In fact, once I came an hour early because I thought it opened at an earlier time. Of course, I couldn't show my face for a period of time after that.
This review is for the Belltown location. The people there are friendly as you walked through the door and explain to you that happy hour (5-7 pm) is limited to the long bar in the front and the side table structure at the very front of the restaurant. I say structure because it glides along the window in a weird pattern that is aesthetically interesting to see.
I have to say this restaurant has a great happy hour. I define a good happy hour as one where you could get a decent meal just off of ordering from the happy hour listings alone. You can get cheap but delicious wine options ($6 bubbles don't mind if I do). Good apps to share (if you are into that). Plus actual pasta options like 2 different dishes of spaghetti depending on your interest. Plus I appreciate that they have an actual dessert on the happy hour menu as well.
Myself, like many others before me, have chosen the gnocchi alla romana thinking it would be the small ones we know. I won't call it a mistake because I enjoyed the dish, but I think they can call it out more so people know what to expect.
But the main reason I go back to this restaurant, even if I have to cross from the Eastside is for something that isn't even on the menu and isn't available all the time. It is... their bucatini carbonara. I know this is not the first place I had bucatini but it is a good reason why I love it. It is not even available during happy hour but I keep going back for it (I try other good things as well).
The worst part is the guessing game in which you have to see it if it would be available. I could call ahead to check but even I am not that ridiculous and I can try other dishes when I get there. I have been there once where they were going to have it the day after I ate there. I was crushed. But it is a great #treatyourself meal if it is available.
Would I bring a big group to Tavolàta? Not in the winter if you are banking on happy hour. But if we wanted to ball on pasta and other treats, sure. If it was 2-3 people, I would definitely try to get a bar seat. It would be a great and interesting date location.
This was my first Ethan Stowell restaurant when I came to Seattle and it has inspired me to go to more"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Heather W.,"Highly recommend the Pappardelle! Was delicious.
Burrata app, not so much. Their menu changes but it seems they keep different versions of it - when we order it there were figs. Issues were the oddity of the ice cold cheese and rock hard crustinis that are a bit painful to bite into. After enduring for a bit, I decided to ask our server for some fresh bread and that switch helped a bit. If the crustini was a bit thicker cut and more chewy than hard, it would help a lot.
Got 'An appropriate sipper' (bourbon based cocktail) and that was very tasty and enjoyed.
Our table was towards the back along the wall with view into the open kitchen. I always enjoy watching the kitchen prepare meals. Great advertising on their part since it convinced us to get the delicious dessert that was being prepared for a large group. I forgot to take a photo and my memory is fuzzy but since these items change often there isnt much point!
I do appreciate the constantly changing menu; I'm sure this is a popular spot for locals of Seattle. Lovely ambiance, attentive service, delicious italian food."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Michelle A.,Happy hour at Tavolàta is great ! Be warned... you'll need to be first in line with your whole party in order to be seated. The pasta is pretty good. What puts the cherry on top is the fact that the pasta is made from scratch !! How many places can say that ?? Their happy hour brings plates half off and house wines as well. Employees are very friendly and check in on you often to see if you're doing okay. The reason for the 4 star review is because there isn't much seating space around the bar area... which I believe are the only seats available for Happy Hour menu options (could be mistaken). Overall I've come here a couple of times and will continue to do so.
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,David H.,"I really enjoyed having dinner for Seattle Restaurant Week here because they allow you to order anything off of their menu, while most restaurants have a limited menu.
For appetizers, I loved the bruschetta. It was well cooked and the smoked fish was perfect on top. This was probably the only appetizer I enjoyed.
For entrees, we had the rigatoni and the halibut. Right away you can see that the rigatoni comes in a pretty good sized serving. The sauce and meatballs were delicious and had a pleasantly spicy kick to it. I definitely recommend this dish! The halibut was pretty disappointing. It was charred, but a little too charred. Some bites tasted like nothing but char, which was annoying. The rice & sauce that accompanies the halibut was good though. If you're interested in this dish, I'd strongly recommend requesting it to be just lightly charred.
The service here was excellent. Our server gave us a good recommendation for wine and was friendly and attentive all evening long. I've heard that sometimes servers at pricier restaurants can be a little biased against you if you're there for SRW, but they really seem to embrace SRW here.
Overall, Tavolata is not one of my favorites for Italian food but it's still pretty good. Personally, I probably wouldn't come back for anything other than Happy Hour or SRW because there are better affordable options around, but if you decide to come here for dinner it's a solid choice."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Madison S.,"This is my second time to a Tavolàta restaurant. The pasta is pretty dang good. The atmosphere is delightful (think candle light, rustic modern brick, open kitchen). It is rather loud in the restaurant. Can we tough to find good parking, so we paid to park in a lot behind the restaurant. The starter bread was good (not out of this world). The spaghetti dish was really good - noodles were thick and delicious and the sauce was light and yummy. The Pappardelle was good - heavy sauce, orange flavor didn't throw me off a ton, and thick noodles. I preferred the spaghetti dish however because the noodles and sauce were better IMO. The chicken and ricotta meatballs were also very good with the spaghetti. Portions are large - we both took some to go. Price is high.
As a local. I don't think it was worth going again for the price overall, but a nice dining experience for a date night."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Naveed N.,"Yet another Ethan Stowell homerun!
We had reservations for restaurant week- but because I'm a bottomless pit, we figured it wouldn't be enough food and stopping in for happy hour just before would be the right move.
Sat at the bar for happy hour and enjoyed some drinks, and small bites- The baked gnocchi will forever live in my dreams.. truly fantastic.
Dinner/Drinks overall were really great, and I particularly enjoyed the hangar steak they were offering at the time for restaurant week.
It was a bit noisy in the restaurant which made conversation difficult, but I also wasn't expecting a quiet/low-key dining experience so that is okay! I've yet to visit again but plan to fulfill my gnocchi craving very soon. Cheers!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Tara D.,"Food was phenomenal! The duck was amazing, especially the finishing sear. The risotto was creamy and flavorf. Even the starters were great! We ordered the brussel sprouts and squash as well as the bread, and oil and vinegar. Beautiful flavors in everything! I would be happy to come back."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Rebecca W.,"This place has serious date night vibes with the dimmed romantic lighting and with their awesome happy hour you can do date night on a budget! I came to celebrate my friend's birthday recently and the whole experience was amazing! The hostess was super nice and made an exception by letting my two friends sit in the bar area (HH area) before I got there (usually the whole party has to be there). The food tasted amazing at only $12 a plate on the happy hour menu it's a steal!!! They also didn't skimp on the size like I expected for HH and instead the plates were full dinner size. The drink prices were also pretty good with $6 for a well drink and $$4 for a San Juan hard seltzer.
I ordered the spaghetti with chicken ricotta meatballs and I'd give it a 4/5 stars. You can definitely tell the pasta was homemade from the great texture and the sauce was light, but well flavored. I liked the meatballs, but I wish you could taste the ricotta more and that they did 3 slightly smaller meatballs instead of 2 massive ones. I'd definitely order this again! My friend had the Pappardelle and from the one bite I tried I it also tasted really good!
I'm definitely coming back and I highly recommend this place for happy hour (5-7pm)! I might even come back and try the full dinner menu. Thanks for the quality food/drink and I can't wait to come back!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Elly L.,"We had their gnocchetti and pappardelle when we visited Seattle last year. The pastas were al dente and the flavors were very good. I liked the pappardelle flavor a lil more. Gnocchetti's flavor was a lil less than what I expected, but nonetheless it was still good. And they give a generous amount of pasta and sauce.
Next time when I'm in Seattle and is craving for good Italian pasta, I would like to come back here."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Joel Y.,"Deeeelicious! Came here on a Saturday night and even though it was busy, was able to find seating almost right away. The service was great, ambience was superb, and the food was yum.
Ordered the roasted beets which were the best beets I've ever had along with the Pappardelle and the Gnocchi Alla Romana. The food was tasty and wasn't too overfilling which was perfect. Also the drinks where outstanding. Definitely a good place to go if you're in the area."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Emily H.,"Outstanding pasta! A little pricey, but if you're looking for a trendy (possibly intimate) dinner spot and you don't mind paying a little more for your pasta then check it out! I came here with a group of girls for a friend's birthday and we had a great time. Shared the brussels sprouts, they were a little too salty for me but everyone else liked them. For dinner we each got either traditional spaghetti, the butter noodles, or sausage rigatoni. We agreed the rigatoni with the spicy sausage was the best, but the spaghetti was delicious too! The buttered noodles (called something fancier on the menu) were actually pretty good considering it's a rather basic dish. We shared the donuts for dessert and the chocolate sauce they came with was amazing."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Marina K.,Omg the potato gnocchi is the best! Cocktails and service is lovely as well. Great place for family or friend dinner and maybe a first date. We came on a week day around 6pm and got a table no problem but call ahead to make sure they have room. Nice kinda dark ambiance as well. I will def be back!
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Sarah N.,"We stopped in for late night food after our flight landed and we are so Glad we came here. We were hungry, tired, and just need a good meal.
This is true homemade Italian! The ambiance and wait staff and accommodating and amazing. They help with suggestions and are prompt to check on you. The food is so fresh, homemade, and delicious. So many flavors go into each dish that make every bite appreciated.
Wine and beer selection is great - cocktails available too. Would recommend or go back if we have the chance!"
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Ellen C.,"I forgot how good this place is, having gone to the Cap Hill location. My friends and I stopped by for dinner Friday night at around 8pm and got seated quickly without reservations. I ordered the rigatoni and let me say that the pasta was cooked to perfection. I ate that entire dish as if I've never had pasta in my life.
Highly recommend if you've never tried this restaurant."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Julia P.,"LOVE the happy hour menu!! Super affordable and tasty dishes. My personal favorite is the pappardelle, but everything is also delicious. The bread was fresh and warm and the spices and flavors they use in their pastas really come through. I'm no expert in Italian food but and I can tell this is GOOD Italian food :)
If you decide to come here, definitely try go for the happy hour. The bar does fill up quickly so try to come early. Best to come with 2 people."
Tavolàta,(206) 838-8008,Sachi E.,"fun fact: they light every single candle every day!! The ambiance of the restaurant was typical for an Italian restaurant. their food was delicious, my opinion a little over priced - still good tho. Their dessert was my favorite part! Highly recommend their creme brulee :)"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,E. R.,"I am in Seattle to help at UWMC as a Respiratory Therapist. I have been really delighted by my experience here over the last few weeks, which has been made even better with places like this. I ordered a Caesar salad and gnocchi to take with me on my overnight shift. When I stopped to pick up my order (wearing scrubs since I was on my way to work), I was handed my food and my ticket was ripped up. I was really overwhelmed! I have been trying to help local businesses by ordering out as much as possible, but to be recognized for helping during the pandemic is appreciated immensely. The best part? The food was wonderful! Thank you so much, Bizzarro! I will be back and my tip will reflect my gratitude."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Sabryna M.,"A hard five stars for this quirky and authentic Italian restaurant! The first and most notable feature is their magnificent decoration! Bikes hang from the ceiling, ""Big eyes"" paintings with a Wes Anderson narrator on a old time stereo greet you in the bathroom, with many other alluring Knick knacks in every corner.
Not only is the ambiance to die for, BUT THE FOOD! Hand rolled pastas with many other on season dishes for a super reasonable price. They have a famous tomato based sauce that is a must taste (My fave thing on their menu is the ""Margarita"" pasta dish)
Y'all, if you live in/ visit Seattle you literally have to go to this place. If you didn't, that'd be super BIZARRE of you"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Michelle L.,"Oh mine!!!
The place just threw me off completely!
Very small tiny restaurant with corky cute interesting decor.
We got here early around 5:30pm and it was almost full, we took the last 2 seater on the place.
As always, my husband came super prepared, read all the Yelpies' reviews, so he knows what he wants. On the other hand, I just walked in with no clue, so every pasta dish seems yummm.
Our server recommended me to try the Forest Floor Frenzy which is a wild mushroom & walnut parpadelle with cream sherry sauce. This is the most amazing pasta dish I ever have, not exaggerating!! The cream sherry sauce was in a perfect rich creamy consistency coating the think smooth parpadelle. The wild mushrooms had hint of woodiness that might be the sherry sauce amplified must better, and along with the slight crunch of chopped walnuts. I was mmm-ing through every bite.
Then I swapped with my husband's order, the Elk Bolognese. He didn't seem to be too excited about it, but when he passed me his dish, and I took a swift, the aroma captivated me already. The rich sweet peppery smell was making me drool! The elk was pretty lean and not gamey, so blended right in with the pork shoulder. The parpadelle was just the right chew and thinness, amazing!!
I tried the dessert of the day, chevre cheesecake with rosemary graham crust & vanilla olive oil roasted grapes & a black vanilla tea honey sauce. Yeah, you heard me, chevre cheesecake!! It was definitely heavenly! I never had a goat cheesecake before, and I have to say, I'm never a big fan of goat cheese, but I just cannot stop nodding my head and squinting my chinese eyes and giggle! This cheesecake was so delicious!! The goat cheese was on the mild side with some lemon zest or lemon juice blended in that popped in my mouth. I was super happy with the vanilla live oil roasted grapes, taste exactly what it sound, amazingly delicious! It's rare to see olive oil used in dessert so I was very intrigued. Lastly, the black vanilla tea honey sauce had some depth from the tea aroma which blended the cheesecake and rosemary graham crust very well. BEST GOAT CHEESECAKE ever! Even though it was my first
When we left shortly after 6pm, there were at least 3-4 parties waiting outside the restaurant, so do try to come early! Free street parking in the neighborhood, just to make sure not to block someone's driveway
I am still super stoked and savoring all the tastes from this amazing dinner! Already thinking when I can come back!!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Erin M.,"We're headed back tonight so I guess I should get around to reviewing our last experience!
We arrived around 8 on a Weeknight and I had had a terrible day, it was pouring, we were freezing and tired, and Italian was calling our name.
Welcomed at the front door, they led us back to the ""Best Table in the House"" - a tiny, candlelit table tucked into a little alcove in the back of the restaurant, where the glass table top covers hundreds of little notes left on the back of dinner receipts from others who have sat here.
We always start with Arancini - these are creamy and just the right bit of a bite, crispy and nestled in a little bath of Bizzaro's delicious marinara.
I order the Meatballs, available only on Monday nights. He orders the special - Gnocchi with Italian sausage.
The server is the same woman who has waited on us our last 5 times here - I wish I knew her name so I could give her the recognition she deserves. She's funny, so friendly, and just the right amount of attentive. We love her!
Food arrives - gnocchi is pillowy and rich, slightly chewy, drenched in a delicious, creamy, herb filled cream sauce. The meatballs are tucked into a perfectly cooked pile of pasta - not spaghetti, but a shorter, thicker, rolled tube noodle covered in light and garlicky marinara, and swaddled in a blanket of melted cheese.
We are far enough away from other tables that we
can enjoy the bits of their conversation that we hear, but we are private enough to enjoy our own.
For dessert, we had gelato that came with some pretty cute little friends on top - that I didn't even mind beheading to scoop up a bit of melted gelato.
Bottom line - we didn't need romance but it's impossible not to get swept up in it if you're here with someone you love. We didn't need for anything while we were there because the service is excellent. And we didn't need two boxes for leftovers because the boyfriend ate his whole plate clean.
Please go here. Please keep this place alive. Bizzaros is a gem that should be shined!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Marissa K.,"Even in this crazy time, the amazing humans at Bizzarro went above and beyond to make a birthday special. And, of course, the food was incredible. Every experience with Bizzarro is better than the last. Thank you!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Jessica M.,"The food didn't match the hype for us, but the service was exceptional.
3 stars for the food and 5 for the service so we'll leave it a 4 overall.
Came here on a Monday night just before the prime dinner rush, and thankfully we did. This place was fulllll. Even with two large parties, our server gave us plenty of attention and was so sweet. This restaurant has parking right in front, although only a handful of spots, and has the quirkiest decor.
We ordered the meatballs and spaghetti with starter salad, elk bolognese with onion soup, and the fainting goat gelato for dessert.
The pasta itself was just ok - I really wished I had liked it more given all the raving reviews. I'm tempted to come back here to try some of the other pasta dishes though."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Patrick C.,"This is the cutest cafe with lots of little bits and baubles everywhere. The place is always busy and usually requires a wait. After a handful of visits, I think I'm done with Bizzarros cafe. The food quality for the price point just isn't up to snuff. I recently ordered some cacio e peppe - and it was like eating a giant bowl of bland noddles. I would guess that to make that dish a star you need super fresh and spicy pepper along with noodles cooked to perfection. Nope. I think for the money Zouave over on 65th is much, and less insanely crowded."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Safina H.,Ordered twice now via caviar. SO TASTY! I'm sad I haven't yet visited the restaurant.
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Linda L.,"Came here for dinner and the experience absolutely blew my mind. The environment is quirky and unique, and the service is excellent. The food though - - WOW. We had the arancini to start. The sauce around the arancini was some of the best that I have ever tasted. We also tried the seasonal pumpkin gnocchi with Italian sausage, as well as the wild mushroom parapadelle. Both were very rich, with superb flavor. I can't wait to go back to try the wild elk bolognese, which is their most popular dish. They serve wine casual Italian style, out of rocks glasses.
If you come after 5:30 you can expect a wait. Definitely will be a wait if you come after 6"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Regina X.,"Snap pea carbonara had the right flavors with the heavy cheesiness cut by the crispy snap peas and pancetta. The linguini, however, was overcooked and a sad lump hard to separate. For appetizer, the Arancini rice balls were heavy and cheesy but made for a nicely textured dish. Love the outlandish decor and would be back for more pasta."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Alex O.,"I don't like it. The bread was just not tasty and it felt old & stale. I got the eggplant Parmesan fritters for the appetizer. It was inconsistent. Sometimes it was spicy and sometimes it wasn't. It also felt like an amateur cooked it. Cut slices of eggplant, deep fry it, slather tomato sauce and cheese. Serve. Felt very fast food. The forest floor is basically mushroom sauce and pasta. If you love mushrooms then get this. Otherwise, it has an overwhelming amount of fungi. The sugar snap carbonara was a huge disappointment. Trust me the pasta is not made in house and if it is...it sure doesn't taste like it. It felt over cooked and soggy and reminded me of ramen noodles. Also, the sauce is bland. The reason why people like it is because the bacon and peas have a lot of flavor.
The garlic soup is extra buttery and has cloves of garlic. It was way too extreme for me.
Dessert sucked!! Honestly, if they bought the dessert from an outside source it would have probably tasted better."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Brittini C.,"So we ordered take out from here this weekend and was a little disappointed. 1) Their ""small salad "" for 10 bucks is nothing more than about three pieces of lettuce and one strip of carrot - definitely NOT worth it. 2) They completely forgot adding the chicken on one of our pastas which was an extra charge 3) They packaged the other pasta horribly and the sauce spilled completely in the bag. What was left was thin and insubstantial- for a 20 dollar pasta dish I expected ALOT more. 4) I will say, their chicken dish was AMAZING. Almost worth overlooking their shortcomings. Almost. Unfortunately there is far too many good restaurants bringing their A game to consider being a repeat customer."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,SonyA C.,"This is my favorite Italian place in Seattle. It has a cozy and interesting ambiance and the food is phenomenal. I especially love the bread and the seasonal dishes. Each entree comes with a fresh salad, with optional upgrade to Caesar salad, spinach salad, or soup. I honestly liked the starter salad the best.
All our dishes felt very high quality. They were well made and their ingredients seemed especially good. My favorite dish was the forest floor frenzy and it's assortment of mushrooms. So tasty.
In conclusion, this would be a great place for a date night. Tasty food, cozy ambiance, unusual decor, and not too loud to have conversation. Watch out though, it's popular and if you go at prime dinner time, you'll need to wait."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Jessica T.,"My family and I were on vacation in Seattle and stopped here for dinner. We all loved the look and feel of the place. Atmosphere is definitely bizzarro.
There was no wait time for a table of 4/weeknight.
Starter salad had a mild, sweet dressing that even our pickiest teenager enjoyed.
Food was really good. Forest Floor Frenzy was creamy and mushroomy heaven.
Lasagna- good
Meatballs-great
Antipasta plate-great
What else about this place? The bathrooms. Weird recording playing in one of them with paintings of big eyed children. Creepy and intriguing."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Ra L.,"Amazing house made gluten free pasta, spectacular food all around especially their seasonal dishes, the staff is absolutely amazing, good wine"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Mahsa S.,the restaurant has a great atmosphere with eclectic decor. It's fairly small so expect a long wait. The food was good but a bit expensive for just simple marinara pasta and cheese. The complimentary bread was delicious though
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Nishita K.,Highly recommend the tiramisu! Best I have had in a long time. Aranciji was okay. The pastas were delicious. The proportions were great. I had the seasonal pasta 'bombastica'. It was white wine based not too acidic. Very light and flavorful. The elk pasta was hearty and very flavoful. I thought I wouldn't like it because it's elk meat but I would definitely get it for myself next time. Forest floor frenzy as well as the chicken main course we're delicious. Service was great! The servers were very cheerful and gave some nice recommendations and answered our questions. They served us some bread while we waited for our food. We waited for about 30/35 mins on a Friday night to get a table for 4.
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Tayler H.,"Bizzaros is a kooky and perfect little Italian hole-in-the-wall! I 10/10 recommend eating here. It's easy to access right off the I-5 freeway, and is in a very cute and ""old"" restaurant row.
The restaurant itself is very homey, with ""bizzare"" decor. Loved the romantic/fun lighting. Our waitress was very nice.
The food itself was fresh and different than what I've had before. We really enjoyed our dinner here!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Ray M.,"This spot is a must for locals and visitors. It is quintessential Seattle in all the right ways.
I love this spot because it is as fun as it is tasty. And it is very fun... and very tasty. So much eye candy and everything on the menu is ridiculously good.
If you haven't been to Bizzarro, then I recommend you go. And if you are planning to go to Bizzarro, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the lasagna - you're welcome :) Enjoy"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,(206) 632-7277,Nita L.,"Most aptly named, this place is a Bizarre combination of Romantic yet Eclectic.
Ambience:
You have candle lit tables and an assortment of chandeliers, you also have skeletal brides seated on a carriage hanging off the ceiling. (Not kidding)
Food:
We had the Elk Bolognese: My first time tasting Elk, and for those who are afraid to try it, this tastes very similar to lamb. The pasta and elk were both fantastic. If you are familiar with the Pakistani/Indian dish called ""Kheema"", this was like having Elk Kheema over pasta. Delicious!
We also had the ""I gnocchi what you did last summer"", delicious creamy gnocchi. Those who like blue cheese will love this. It is cooked in a walnut and blue cheese based sauce.
We ended the meal with the Tiramisu for dessert. It was Humungous and delightful to the last bite.
Service & Cost:
The servers are friendly and service is quick. The prices here are not too terrible, cost us ~70 (not including tip) for two people- we had a carafe of wine, two entrees and dessert. Pretty decent for the food & ambience!
I've read other reviews complaining about the wait time, but I went on a Tuesday evening so I did not face this issue. Definitely a fantasic choice for your dose of Italian, Romance and crazy! Ill be back for sure."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Juanita K.,Thank you so much for your support. We look forward to being open again !!!
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Piko L.,"""I'm so full but I must keep eating"" is the motto you leave with after dining here!
Everything here is delicious-- from their bruschetta to their seafood pastas, their pizzas and calzones, nothing disappoints. It's ALL good!
The place is great for dates or groups, and the cute orange walls really set the mood.
I can't wait to come back in the daytime for outside seating so I can get a good photo of this delicious pasta!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Valerie S.,"Delicious Italian food!
We ordered takeout since we wanted to eat at the comfort of our own place that was just beside the restaurant as I read that service could be better. I looooooove carbonara pasta and was stoked to see it on the menu w their homemade spaghetti. It had just the right touch of cream, bacon, and cheese. Mmm! Although I was eyeing the pesto penne, we went with the spaghetti de mare because my mom wanted something w seafood. That was light and scrumptious as well. If you're looking for a pasta wo cheese, that's a great choice! The mixed salad is as normal as any salad w oil and vinegar. Their tiramisu was so creamy and not too sweet. It was the icing on top of an already totally above our expectations meal. If you're in the area, stop by for some homemade pasta. Your tastebuds and stomach will thank you!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Judy M.,"Tbh we were supposed to trot over to the Pink Door on this night, but we were just too tired to haul everyone back to that area. Yelpers guided us to this spot. We were only a hop and a skip away from this great neighborhood Italian Restaurant! Amongst the dishes we had ordered were the Frutti di mare (seafood pasta), Bolognese, and carbonara. The seafood was cooked perfectly, not overcooked (say no to rubbery seafood!), bolognese had lots of flavor, and carbonara was good. Overall it was satisfying. Our service was excellent, really helped the experience overall.
Although this wouldn't be a designation restaurant, I would still recommend it if you are nearby, and got a hankering for Italian food."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Nancy S.,"The food and service here is just amazing!!! Came here with a friend on the recommendation of another good friend and I have no regrets!
I ordered their seafood spaghetti and was not disappointed- it had sooooooooooo much delish seafood on it!!! The portioning is very generous and the quality exceptional... can't wait to come here again!!!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Lana P.,"Super disappointing. Deserving good reviews brought us here for dinner.
Service sucks and don't mind little fruit flies all over your food. Food was very so so and I could not get out there fast enough to get away from those flies and dirty walls."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Rpisces G.,"First time at this local restaurant, food and service were both really good, will definitely be back. Had the lasagna which was very meaty, delicious."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Abhinav S.,"Had a crave for Italian food, and wanted to try out a new place. So this brought me to La Vita.
Ambiance:
It has a nice dim-lit casual atmosphere. Lunch and dinner is good here.
Service:
Service is alright. They don't do anything out of their way, or even try to be friendly. You're just a paying customer to them, that's about it.
Food:
I'm docking off a star because their bread... how do I put it mildly... is pretty bad, it's store bought! I mean it's literally the same as the $2 Trader Joe's bread that I buy. Even the cheapest Italian places have better bread. The garlic oil is decent.
Onto the main course, now this is where they shine. I had the Pesto Penne, and the pesto was super fresh, and just about everything about their main dishes, including the white sauce pasta is good!
Price and Portion:
Portions are hearty, no complaints there. Infact, mind you, the food is like super rich. Your heart will give out if you eat too much. Price is perfect too.
All in all, if you're willing to forgive their dismal excuse of a bread and look past that, everything else is great!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,D C.,"This is our favorite local Italian place. They have a great menu and we love their specials. The prices are very reasonable, especially for Seattle. We come here so often that many of the staff know who we are and will drop by our table to say hello. We brought our relatives from Italy here for dinner one night and they loved it. The owner,Giuseppe made them feel at home speaking in Italian and bringing all of our dishes family style. Perfect ending to their American vacation :-)"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Francesco L.,I've been coming here for about a year and a half now and this place never disappoints. Great hours and great food. If your looking for some great Italian food in Downtown Seattle this place is a must
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Fraser C.,"I have been dining here a few times a year for over 10 years. The food is AMAZING and the service is great. Some of the best pasta in town!
The quality of food is very high and prices are reasonable."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Sharon C.,"Came here to celebrate my friends' birthdays! There's plenty of street parking. Pretty good prices for pasta here. It was kind of cold, so we were planning to say we wanted to sit inside when the server asked us whether we would want to sit inside or outside. But he never asked...LOL he just seated us outside. I'm sure we could have told him we wanted to be seated inside instead, but we just didn't say anything.
Service was alright otherwise. The waiters were pretty nice.
Free bread! It's not as good as the bread at the Cheesecake Factory, but it was alright.
The presentation of all the pasta dishes we got was very nice! The portions are good for the price too. We had leftovers that we took home.
I got the fettucine tartufo ($18) which has Italian sausage, truffle oil, Italian sausage, and cream sauce. It's definitely on the heavy side, but I liked it. I would give it a 4/5. It's super oily though. Kind of felt like I was eating oil.
We also got the spaghetti di mare ($19), and we were impressed with how much seafood it came with. It comes with tiger prawns, mussels and clams, and they were really generous with the amount. And the price wasn't bad at all for a seafood pasta. The garlic flavor wasn't too strong, and this dish wasn't as heavy as the fettucine. This would probably get a 4.5/5!
The spaghetti carbonara ($15) was so good! Also a 4.5/5. But I really love carbonara. It comes with pancetta, and the spaghetti is so creamyyy. I would probably get this one if I went again."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Stephanie L.,"I had the cannelloni. You read that correctly- that is not cannoli! Think enchiladas but Italian! The big noodles were smothered in bolognese and cheese. Every bite was heaven. The portion is great if you're really hungry. Otherwise lucky you, leftovers for lunch! This is one of the most amazing Italian dishes I've ever had. The atmosphere here is lively as well. I can't wait to go back. I'll try to get something different but something tells me I'll be getting the cannelloni again :)."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Kayla K.,Hi I am so sorry for your experience and very contrary to how we want things to be run for sure. We would love to welcome you back of course on us if you be willing to give us another try. In the meantime if you could describe your server to me that would be most helpful because I certainly will be following up. Thank you for posting a review so that this could be brought to our attention.
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Joan S.,"I went on an excursion today with my dog and walk down second Avenue just to see what was down there and I went to this restaurant the food was amazing they allowed me to bring my dog in and sit at a table I had the biggest Caesar salad I've ever had in my whole life and the lasagna was enough for two people extremely fresh and they gave me garlic bread and a whole meal was $24. Really?
The atmosphere was very upbeat pleasant nice to look at maybe it was because of the weather outside but I would definitely take my friends there. if you go order the lasagna and they might even give you some garlic bread and bring your dog but you'll probably have to sit outside I was allowed to sit inside .this place ranks 5 stars restaurant,
You might also meet Giuseppe Forte the owner"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Maddie E.,"We discovered this place on Postmates and keep coming back for more. If you're looking for pasta, the carbonara is a MUST get. It's incredible. Their bread and salads are mediocre but I strictly come here for carbonara."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Douglas W.,"Amazing service. They weren't super busy but seemed to be under staffed. Our waiter was juggling multiple tables but knew how to handle it. When he felt he wasn't visiting us fast or often enough he'd do a drive by and update us on where we stood. That small gesture makes the difference. My wife and I just took the time to have a great conversation about our vacation in Seattle.
Once the food arrive it was nothing short of AMAZING!"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Crystal F.,"Hi, is that what Grubhub told you? Because that is not the case. If you are not satisfied with the dish we are more than happy to refund you. I’ve been making that carbonara recipe for the last 20 years, my only thought is perhaps for delivery may not be the best option, but if you’re not satisfied I’m more than happy to try to make you satisfied. We do not have the power to issue refunds only Grubhub does, so I’m not sure why they wouldn’t just refund you. Let me know if you were able to get it sorted out with them and if not I can try to reach out to them I just need to know some more information from you in order to try to find the order. Again sorry you were not happy"
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,JC J.,"Service was great
Food was very tasty
Ambiance: terrible, my eyes are really bad, and the place is just too damn dark, I cant read the menu. Had to open my cell phone flashlight to read the menu. The pizza was good, but the sausage could have been more.. it was just sprinkled with a few shredded sausages... was just in the center of the pie.
Overall was good. I'd come again, but next time I will try to request to sit outside patio. 3 stars for now, I'll change my rating next time I come back."
La Vita E Bella,(206) 441-5322,Edward S.,"La Vita E Bella is a nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Belltown. It has a really old school feel to it. In English, the name translates to Life and Beautiful, which is a good name.
The reviews were kind of mixed, but I guess I came on a good night. The wine list was good--I ordered some nice red. For the appetizer I had the Caprese salad--it was really good with nice, fresh tomatoes.
For the main course I had a cheese pizza. I thought it was really good. The crust was nice and thin and I loved the tomato sauce.
I will definitely be back"
